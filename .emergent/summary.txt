The AI engineer's trajectory involved an iterative debugging and feature implementation cycle for the LeagueAce application. Initially, the focus was on resolving discrepancies in the Manager's view where joined players were not visible or counts were incorrect, despite backend verification. This led to multiple frontend fixes in  to ensure real-time updates via SSE, cache-busting on API calls, stable state management for  modal, and addressing UI rendering inconsistencies. Concurrently, the sign-in/sign-up flow for both players and managers was refactored. This included improving clarity for existing users, implementing session persistence using , hiding skill rating for managers during signup, and finally, integrating robust email+password authentication on the backend ( with ) and frontend. The process involved frequent user interaction, specific bug reports, providing QA datasets, and targeted frontend/backend testing. The ultimate goal was to ensure accurate player visibility for managers and a fully functional, persistent authentication system.

<product_requirements>
LeagueAce is a tennis and pickleball league management application featuring an iOS-inspired UI and PWA capabilities. Key features include dashboard and chat fixes, secure league joining, comprehensive player profile management, manager tools for rating tier modification and join approval, and a Doubles Coordinator. A major focus is the complex Round Robin (RR) league format, supporting configurable seasons, subgroups, scheduling, 3-set matches, scoring, leaderboards, playoffs, and in-app notifications. The application also supports robust social login (Google/Apple) for Players and League Managers, with role-based navigation and persistence. Managers can create/manage leagues, view player lists with real-time updates, and upload profile pictures. The recent work addressed critical issues where managers couldn't see joined players in the Tier 3 card or Player List, and improved the login experience, including implementing secure email+password authentication and session persistence.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed implementing a full email + password authentication system and enhanced session persistence. This addressed user concerns about the lack of a clear sign-in option for form-created accounts and session data disappearing on page refresh.

**Backend () changes:**
-   Introduced  and  for secure password hashing.
-   Created a new endpoint  for authenticating users via email and password, returning the user object upon successful validation.
-   Modified  (for form-based signup) to accept  and  fields, hashing and storing the password securely.

**Frontend () changes:**
-   Updated the signup form to include  and  fields. The Current Skill Rating field is now correctly hidden for League Manager signups.
-   The Sign in with Email panel now prominently displays fields for Email and Password (with an optional Name), calling the new  endpoint. A fallback supports email-only login for legacy accounts without passwords.
-   Session persistence was configured to Session-only (as requested by the user), meaning user data (, , ) is stored in  and rehydrated on page reload within the same browser tab, but cleared when the tab is closed.
-   Manager social sign-in was improved with Override email and Override name inputs to ensure correct role assignment during Google/Apple sign-in.

The current state is that the application supports both social and email+password login, with appropriate form fields and session persistence, significantly improving the authentication experience. The AI engineer is now awaiting user confirmation on further UI enhancements or testing.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to ask the user if they want to add a Forgot password placeholder UI and/or run automated backend tests.
