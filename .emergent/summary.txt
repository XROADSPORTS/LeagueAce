<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily involved an intensive bug-fixing and feature-enhancement phase for the LeagueAce application, with a strong focus on the Round Robin (RR) module and core user flows. Initial work established RR backend logic and a frontend dashboard. Key efforts included resolving a frontend compilation error (), fixing manager login redirection, implementing dynamic skill progression labels, and addressing multiple issues with league creation and persistence for managers. Critical bugs related to player Join by Code and the display of joined leagues were resolved, followed by real-time updates for player counts via Server-Sent Events (SSE). The most recent development centered on integrating user profile pictures across various UI components and fixing the profile picture upload functionality. The approach was iterative, confirming fixes with the user and asking for explicit testing permissions.

<product_requirements>
LeagueAce is a tennis and pickleball league management application, emphasizing an iOS-inspired Glassmorphism UI and PWA capabilities. Its core functionality includes dashboard and chat fixes, a secure league joining system with shareable codes and manager approval, and comprehensive player profile management (name, mobile, LAN, search). Manager tools allow rating tier modification and join request approval. The Doubles Coordinator provides verified partnerships, scheduling, and dual-confirmation scoring.

Current major development focuses on the complex Round Robin (RR) league format. This system supports configurable seasons, optional subgroups, active/reserve player roles, advanced scheduling (minimizing repeat partners, balancing opponents, availability), 3-set matches with partner rotation, coin toss, manual overrides, detailed scoring, live leaderboards with trends and badges, playoff bracket generation, in-app notifications, and audit trails. The application also now includes robust social login (Google/Apple) for both Players and League Managers, with role-based navigation and persistence. Managers can create and manage leagues with auto-loading format and rating tiers, view player lists with real-time updates, and upload profile pictures, which are rendered across various UI components for enhanced user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the extensive task of integrating user profile pictures across various parts of the LeagueAce application. This included ensuring that profile picture uploads work correctly after social sign-in (specifically Google).

The backend was updated to:
-   Provide a  endpoint for uploading  files, storing them in a dedicated  directory, and serving them via .
-   Modify existing APIs, such as  and , to include the  for each user, so the frontend can render actual images instead of placeholders.

The frontend () was updated to:
-   Utilize the  from user data to display actual profile pictures in the Manager's Tier 3 Player List modal, next to players' names, LANs, and ratings.
-   Render avatars in the Round Robin Standings leaderboard and on individual Round Robin match cards for all four players.
-   Ensure that after a profile picture upload, the user object is refreshed, making the new avatar available application-wide.
-   Automated frontend tests were run to verify the profile upload flow, the Tier 3 Player List with avatars, RR leaderboard avatars, and RR match card avatars, successfully passing after a minor JSX key wrapper issue was fixed.

The current state is that profile pictures are integrated and displaying in key areas, and the upload functionality is verified. The AI engineer is now awaiting user input on further enhancements related to avatar rendering and manager controls.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to get user confirmation on whether to add an Edit Avatar button per player in the Manager's Player List modal (A), or show avatars in Non-RR Player Standings (B), or both (C), and the policy for manager photo edits.
