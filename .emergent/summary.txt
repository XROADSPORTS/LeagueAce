The trajectory details the continued development of the LeagueAce application, with a significant focus on implementing the complex Round Robin (RR) league format. Initially, the AI engineer established core backend functionality for RR availability and a advanced scheduler (greedy with backtracking, conflict detection, quality scoring). This was followed by features like 3-set partner rotation, coin toss, 4-player confirmation for partner overrides, and refined standings with trends and badges.

Frontend development for Round Robin then began, introducing a dedicated RR tab with interactive match cards, a detailed 3-set score table, and an Admin Wizard for configuration. Automated frontend testing revealed blockers in core authentication and user profile endpoints, which the AI engineer resolved by implementing necessary social login and user data APIs. The latest interaction involved the user reporting a login as league manager bug, which the AI engineer traced to a frontend compilation error (duplicate  declaration) and successfully fixed. The work is currently paused for the user to re-verify the manager login and overall RR features.

<product_requirements>
LeagueAce is a tennis and pickleball league management application, providing comprehensive tools for league administration and player engagement. Its UI features an iOS-inspired Glassmorphism design and PWA capabilities for mobile readiness.

Key implemented features include:
-   **UI/Mobile**: Modern iOS-style glassmorphism interface and Progressive Web App functionality.
-   **Core Fixes**: Resolution of various bugs affecting dashboard visibility, chat, scoring, and profile picture loading.
-   **League Joining**: System for shareable join codes (links and QR) and a player-centric join flow with live previews and manager approvals.
-   **Profile Management**: Players can edit their name, mobile number, and a unique LeagueAce Number (LAN); search functionality by name or LAN.
-   **Manager Tools**: Functionality for managers to modify rating tier ranges and approve/reject player join requests.
-   **Doubles Coordinator**: A complete system for verified doubles partnerships, including external and in-app invite mechanisms, team creation, preferences, match scheduling, dual-confirmation scoring, and team standings.

**Ongoing Development: Round Robin League Format**:
This is a complex system for doubles-only round robin leagues, requiring configurable seasons, optional subgroups, and active/reserve player roles. Core requirements include an advanced scheduler (minimizing repeat partners, balancing opponents, respecting availability), 3-set matches with partner rotation, coin toss, manual overrides, detailed scoring (set points, game points, tiebreaks), a live leaderboard (Top-8, trends, badges), playoff bracket generation, in-app notifications, and audit trails. Development adheres to extensive acceptance tests and wireframe notes.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: This file serves as the core FastAPI backend, defining all API routes, business logic, and interactions with MongoDB. It manages user authentication, league creation, Doubles Coordinator features, and now extensive Round Robin (RR) functionalities.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Heavily modified throughout the trajectory for RR features and unblocking frontend tests.
        -   **RR Core**: Implemented ,  (with advanced greedy+backtracking scheduler, availability constraints, partner/opponent balancing, , , ). Added  helper, refined standings calculation for  and badges.
        -   **RR Match Operations**: Endpoints for , ,  (requiring 4 confirmations). Includes  and  stubs.
        -   **RR Metadata**: New  endpoint to return persisted schedule metadata.
        -   **Onboarding/User**: Added  (upserts user, sets role), , , and  (for fetching leagues managed by a user).

    -   **Summary of importance**: The primary React component, controlling the application's overall UI structure, routing, and integrating all functional components.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Continuously updated to integrate Round Robin UI.
        -   **RR Dashboard**: Replaced the generic Schedule tab with a dedicated Round Robin tab. Introduced  component, featuring a tier selection dropdown (auto-detects player's RR tiers), weekly tabs displaying match cards (with Toss, Propose/Confirm Override actions, conflict badges per week), and a Match Detail panel.
        -   **Interactive Match Detail**: The Match Detail view now includes an interactive 3-set table for score input, visualizes default/override partner rotations, allows ICS download for confirmed matches, and integrates actions for proposing slots, confirming overrides, submitting scores, and approving scores.
        -   **Admin Wizard**: Integrated a basic RR Admin Wizard for configuring tier details, generating subgroups, and running the scheduler with  inputs, displaying schedule quality/conflicts.
        -   **Login Flow**: Modified  to pass the  (Player/League Manager) to the backend's social login endpoint.
        -   **Bug Fix**: Resolved a  caused by a duplicate   declaration.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Holds global CSS styles, crucial for maintaining the consistent iOS-style Glassmorphism aesthetic across the application.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Modified to style new Round Robin UI elements, including conflict badges, match cards, and Admin Wizard components.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The main HTML entry point for the React application, responsible for linking the manifest and setting PWA properties.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Updated to include  link and iOS-specific web-app meta tags to enhance PWA functionality.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The PWA manifest file, essential for enabling Add to Home Screen functionality and defining the application's metadata for mobile devices.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Doubles Coordinator**: Enable Email + SMS sending for partner invites, requiring SendGrid and Twilio API keys.
-   **Round Robin**:
    -   Further enhance the Admin Wizard: add export/download of schedule meta (CSV/JSON) and a compare-history view for multiple runs, improve visuals (progress steps, inline summary).
    -   Implement specific polish: per-week conflict drill-down, substitute management UI, chat integration in match detail.
-   **User Search**: Replace the current prompt-based user search for in-app invites with a more polished, glass-styled modal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user: login as league manager isnt working. This issue manifested as a frontend compilation error: .

The AI engineer successfully identified and fixed the root cause of the compilation error in  by removing a duplicate declaration of . This fix now allows the frontend to compile successfully.

Prior to this bug, a significant set of Round Robin features had been implemented and tested:
1.  **Backend Enhancements**:
    *   Persisted schedule metadata (feasibility, quality, conflicts) via a new  endpoint.
2.  **Frontend UI for Round Robin**:
    *   **Dashboard**: Displayed per-week conflict badges (e.g., 2⚠︎) in week tabs, and a Conflicts/Quality button showing a toast with scheduling metrics.
    *   **Match Detail**: The 3-set match table became interactive, allowing users to input team scores and select winners per set, which then correctly posts to . It visually shows default or override partner rotations.
    *   **Admin Wizard**: Fully integrated into the RR tab, allowing configuration of tier details (season length, name), generation of subgroups, scheduling with  inputs, and displaying updated schedule metadata.

Crucially, earlier frontend testing blockers (404 errors on onboarding/user endpoints) were resolved by implementing , , , and  on the backend, ensuring a complete and tested onboarding and user data flow, which in turn unblocked end-to-end frontend UI testing. The current status is that the compilation issue is resolved, and the system is ready for the user to re-verify the login as league manager functionality and the full Round Robin features.
