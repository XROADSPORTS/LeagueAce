The previous AI engineer successfully brought the LeagueAce application from MVP to a production-ready state, as initially summarized. The subsequent trajectory, under the current engineer, showcases a highly iterative and responsive development cycle. This involved implementing a modern iOS-style glassmorphism UI, a PWA baseline for mobile, and resolving several critical bugs related to player dashboard visibility and profile picture loading. Significant effort was also put into enhancing the league joining experience, making join codes persistent, shareable via links and QR codes, and hardening the player join-by-code logic with detailed validation and error feedback. Furthermore, player profile editing and a manager-side join request approval system were introduced. The work consistently involved frontend (React, CSS) and backend (FastAPI) modifications, with frequent re-verification and immediate adaptation to user feedback. The current state is a functional LeagueAce application with comprehensive league management and player interaction features, now pivoting to implement a complex Doubles Coordinator system.

<product_requirements>
The core requirement was to build LeagueAce, a tennis & pickleball league management application, initially with basic user, league, match, and scoring functionalities, styled with a Glassmorphism UI (iOS 26-inspired, evolving from orange to blue).

Key enhancements and bug fixes requested/implemented throughout the trajectory:
-   **UI/UX Modernization**: Implement modern iOS-style glassmorphism effects for buttons, icons, and containers, including semi-transparent backgrounds with blur, rounded shapes, subtle shadows, depth, smooth animations, and a modern color palette.
-   **Mobile App Readiness**: Establish a Progressive Web App (PWA) baseline for mobile functionality.
-   **Dashboard/Feature Visibility Fixes**: Resolve critical bugs where players could not see joined leagues, chat functionality, or scoring system after signing in, and address a ProfilePicture component scope error causing crashes.
-   **League Join Code Persistence & Sharing**: Ensure generated league joining codes for rating tiers remain visible for managers, are easily shareable, and are reliably usable by players. Implement join-by-link and QR code sharing.
-   **Robust Player Join Flow**: Enhance the player-side join-by-code process with robust normalization, live previews of league/tier details, clear inline error messages for invalid codes or out-of-range ratings, and a disabled join button if conditions are not met.
-   **Player Profile Editing**: Allow players to edit their Name and Mobile number from their profile, with proper save/cancel functionality and validation.
-   **Manager-Side Tier Management & Join Requests**: Enable league managers to edit rating tier min/max ranges. Implement a Request to Join flow for players with out-of-range ratings, allowing managers to approve/reject these requests (auto-adjusting tier range on approval).
-   **Homepage Refinement**: Simplify duplicate Find Your Match headings on the homepage to a single instance.
-   **Doubles Coordinator System**: A new, comprehensive feature request to manage verified doubles teams end-to-end. This includes account verification, partner link invites, team record creation, shared availability/venue preferences, team placement in rankings, schedule generation, dual-confirmation score capture, standings updates, and handling of various edge cases (duplicates, subs, disputes).

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was presented with a new, comprehensive feature request: to implement a Doubles Coordinator system. This is a large-scale feature requiring significant additions and modifications across both the frontend and backend.

The detailed requirements for the Doubles Coordinator system include:
-   **Role**: LeagueAce’s Doubles Coordinator.
-   **Goal**: Create or link a verified doubles partnership for a specific league, ensuring both players are authenticated and eligible, placing the team into the league’s rankings/ladder, scheduling matches, and recording results with dual confirmation.
-   **Inputs to collect**: League details (name, tier, format, scoring), Player A details (name, ID, email, mobile, venue, rating, verification status), Player B details (same as Player A), Team preferences (home venue(s), availability, max subs, ladder/seeding notes).
-   **Constraints & Checks**: Both players must have verified accounts, accept the same Partner Link Invite, not belong to another active doubles team in the same league division (unless allowed), and meet league eligibility (rating, residency, age, dues). Admin overrides require logging.
-   **Actions (in order)**:
    A) Search players; offer account creation/verification if not found.
    B) Send Partner Link Invites; create Team record upon dual acceptance.
    C) Collect and store shared availability and venue preferences.
    D) Place team into rankings/ladder (provisional by rating, seeding by rating); log rationale.
    E) Generate schedule (auto or on-demand), propose slots, lock on dual confirmation, send ICS.
    F) After matches, capture score from one side, require co-sign from partner and one opponent; flag discrepancies.
    G) Update standings (team W-L, sets %, games %, rating delta) and individual stats.
-   **Edge cases to handle**: Duplicate accounts, name collisions, expired invites, partner swaps, substitutes, walkovers, partial matches, rainouts, no-shows, disputes.
-   **Authentication & Partner Linking**: Account verification (email/SMS OTP, device trust), league eligibility gate, Partner Link flow (Player A invites, Player B accepts/signs up if new), anti-duplication checks.
-   **Ranking/Seeding Logic**: Provisional ladder placement or seeding for round-robin/brackets. Points table with tiebreakers.
-   **Scheduling Workflow**: Availability capture, proposal engine, ICS delivery, rescheduling rules, rainout/no-show rules.
-   **Score Entry & Validation**: Structured set scores, dual confirmation, auto-checks, stats updates.
-   **Substitutes & Partner Changes**: Team subs, permanent partner swaps.
-   **Anti-abuse & Fairness**: One verified person per profile, prevent self-pairing, lock roster changes, transparent audit trail.
