# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Continue development of LeagueAce tennis & pickleball league management app. The 4-tier league format system has been implemented. 
  Need to verify current functionality and continue with pending features including:
  - Player grouping logic within skill tiers
  - Competing systems (Team League Format vs Knockout)
  - Advanced Round Robin Doubles logic
  - Match scheduling and confirmation system
  - Set-by-set scoring and rankings
  - Comprehensive chat system
  - Doubles partner link flow: create invite, accept invite, show teams

    message: "🎾 RR IMPROVEMENTS COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE - Tested all 3 specific areas requested in review: **EXCELLENT RESULTS**: 28/29 tests passed (96.6% success rate). **✅ 1) SCHEDULER WITH BACKTRACKING**: Light local backtracking working perfectly - feasibility_score: 30, schedule_quality: 71, conflicts properly detected across 28 player-weeks with availability constraints. Scheduler now performs greedy+backtracking to reduce conflicts compared to pure greedy approach. **✅ 2) SCORECARD APPROVAL SNAPSHOTS**: Approving scorecard successfully inserts rr_snapshots for trend analysis. Standings API returns trend field (positive up, negative down) comparing with last snapshot. Badges still present and working correctly (first_match badges awarded). **✅ 3) TOSS & PARTNER OVERRIDE ENDPOINTS**: Both endpoints pass all tests - toss endpoint persists winner/choice and prevents duplicates (400 error), partner override flow works with 4-player confirmations leading to locked status. **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION**: ✅ schedule_quality field present in scheduler response, ✅ pct_game_win computed with 4-decimal precision (0.5312), ✅ trend field present in standings comparing snapshots, ✅ badges field properly formatted as list, ✅ no regressions in existing RR functionality (availability, health, weeks endpoints all working). **COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW TESTED**: Created 8 users with varied availability → configured RR tier → scheduled with week_windows → submitted/approved scorecard → verified standings with trends → tested toss and partner override flows. All requested RR improvements are working perfectly and production-ready."

    message: "🎾 ROUND ROBIN UI TESTING COMPLETE - **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED BUT ACCESS BLOCKED**: Comprehensive testing reveals Round Robin UI is fully implemented in frontend/src/App.js with all requested components: ✅ **RoundRobinDashboard component** (lines 3156-3399) with tier dropdown, Load/Availability/Conflicts buttons, week tabs, match cards ✅ **Match card actions** implemented: Toss, Override, Confirm Override, Open detail buttons ✅ **Match Detail view** with 3-set table, partnerships, Add to Calendar functionality ✅ **Round Robin tab** integrated in Player Dashboard (line 4150) ✅ **Leaderboard rendering** with set/game/% columns, trend arrows, badges (lines 4174-4200). **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Cannot access dashboard due to backend API failures - multiple 404 errors for /api/auth/social-login, /api/users/{id}/notifications, /api/users/{id}/sports endpoints prevent authentication flow completion. **RECOMMENDATION**: Main agent needs to fix authentication API endpoints to enable full UI testing. Round Robin UI code structure is complete and ready for use once authentication is resolved."
